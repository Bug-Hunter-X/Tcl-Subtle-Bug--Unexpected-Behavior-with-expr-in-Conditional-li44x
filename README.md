This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Tcl code involving the use of the 'expr' command within a conditional statement. The bug causes unexpected behavior due to how Tcl performs variable substitution. The 'bug.tcl' file contains the erroneous code, while 'bugSolution.tcl' provides the corrected version and explanation.
